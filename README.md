Really Ugly don't look

To use : 

- Open a connection with ws://IP:PORT
- Send anything with a string inside, (like "a")
It will send you back a json as : 

{
    direction:"in" or "out",
    rate:int16,
    text:char
}

So you can do request by request and receive new data to display on your screens


cat ssl_certificate.crt intermediate_certificate.crt > combined.crt
